## Visual Notes and link Analysis

![[StringBoard.bmp]]


___
### Graph View 
- Automated with limited presentation controls
- Only presents note to note relationship
- Is NOT automated Analyst Notebook

---
![[Large Graph View.png]]
___
### Canvas
- Visual Notetaking, not link analysis specific
- The only thing somewhat proprietary in obsidian
	- Possible ANB conversion in the works
---
![[Canvas Demo.png]]

---

### Obsidian Strength/Weaknesses (without plug ins)

---

- Good: notes/wiki publishing/case management/organizing/discovering
- Bad: word processing/spreadsheet/database/multiple users

---
- Good: Reads and links to PDF
- Bad: but does not search PDF
---

- Bad: Only searches text/markdown and canvas files
- Bad: No batch convert without plugins
- Good: ANY text file (txt, csv) is markdown by changing to extension to .md
- Work Arounds: MS Office Macros, ANB importers, Full Adobe Acrobat install

---
### File Conversions workarounds
- Completed
	- Batch Import MS Word to Obsidian Note
	- Batch conversion of .txt to .md
	- Batch conversion of .csv to .md
- Working
	- Export Obsidian Graph to MS Excel to ANB
	- Export Obsidian Canvas to ANB 
	- Batch import MS Excel to Obsidian Note
	- Batch import PDF to obsidian note
