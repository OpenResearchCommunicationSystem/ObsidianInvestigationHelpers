## Obsidian Data Storage

Obsidian stores your notes as [[Markdown]]-formatted plain text files in a _vault_. A vault is a folder on your local file system, including any subfolders.

Because notes are .md (text with format instruction) you can use other text editors and file managers to edit and manage notes.

Windows can read a .md file by using preview

Obsidian automatically refreshes your vault to keep up with any external changes.

You can create a vault anywhere your operating system allows. 

You can open multiple folders as individual vaults, for example to separate notes for work and personal use.

Obsidian creates an `.obsidian` [configuration folder](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Configuration+folder) in the root folder of the vault, which contains preferences specific to that vault, such as [hotkeys](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Hotkeys), [themes](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Themes), and [community plugins](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins).

By default, most operating systems hide folders that start with a period (`.`), so you may need to update the settings for your file manager to see it.

If you already have a folder that you want to use as your vault:

1. To the right of **Open folder as vault**, click **Open**.
2. In the file browser, select the folder you want to use as your vault.
3. Click **Open**.
## Vault within a vault...Don't Do it. 

Because [[Internal links]] are local to a vault, we recommend that you don't create vaults within vaults. Links may not be updated correctly.

## Multiple Users in the same Vault. You can, but should you? 

The vault indexes when it opens and keeps YOUR changes, it does not keep anyone else's. You won't see other peoples work live, you must restart. Working as a team: Team vault with individual folders
## Make a new File structure just for Obsidian. Trust me!

Start with new file structure and slowly migrate.
